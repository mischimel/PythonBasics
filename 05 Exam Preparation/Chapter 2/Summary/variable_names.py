# Variable Naming Rules

# Incorrect: Using a Python keyword as a variable name
#class = "Python Class"  # 'class' is a Python keyword

# Incorrect: Variable name contains a space
#user age = 25  # Variable name 'user age' contains a space

# Correct: Variable name starts with a letter
count = 10

# Correct: Variable name starts with an underscore
_variable = "Value"

# Incorrect: Variable name starts with a digit
#2nd_variable = "Invalid"  # This will result in a syntax error

# Correct: Using letters, digits, and underscores in variable name
student_name = "John"
num_students_1 = 30

# Correct: Using case-sensitive variable names
age = 25
Age = 30

# These two variables are different due to case sensitivity
print(age)  # Output: 25
print(Age)  # Output: 30

# Correct: Using a descriptive variable name
temperature_celsius = 25.5

# Incorrect: Using a vague variable name
x = 25.5 # does not give an error but not proper use
