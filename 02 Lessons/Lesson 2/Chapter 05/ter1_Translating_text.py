# Write a program that translates single words, word fragments or full sentences
# from an arbitrary source language to English. The source language should be
# detected automatically. Texts to be translated into English should be entered
# via the console with entering “stop” for quitting the program. The translation
# itself should be coded using a function. For implementation use an existing
# powerful Python package. Assess the quality of the translations conducted.

# first example that goes into machine learning
