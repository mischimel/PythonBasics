# A company has determined that its annual profit is typically 23 percent of total sales.
# Write a program that asks the user to enter the projected amount of total sales,
# then displays the profit that will be made from that amount.
# Hint: Use the value 0.23 to represent 23 percent.

# Ask for the projected amount of total sales
sales = int(input("Enter the amount of total sales: "))

# Calculate the profit
profit = sales * 0.23

# Print the profit
print("The profit will be: ", profit)
